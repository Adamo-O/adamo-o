<h1 align="center">Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Adamo!</h1>

<h3 align="center">I'm a Software Engineering student in Canada. Here's a bit about me!</h3>

ğŸ’¼ I'm currently interning as a Software Developer at Genetec. I'm working on Azure DevOps infrastructure templates to make future introduction of plugins and API services more modular and simpler.

ğŸ’» I recently finished designing a portfolio website to present my past projects and experience in a more visual way! Check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Adamo-O/Portfolio-website) and the website itself [here](https://adamoorsini.com)!

â˜• On the side, I'm seeking out side projects and signing up for hackathons and competitions to gain some more experience, connections, and skills.
