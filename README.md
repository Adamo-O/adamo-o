<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm <a href="https://adamoorsini.com/">Adamo</a>!</h1>

## I'm a Software Engineering Co-op student in Canada. Here's a bit about me!

- 💼 I'm currently studying at Concordia University, learning software testing and completing various projects. 
- 🛠 I've been working on a Next.JS web application in my free time to hone my React, API development, and database skills.
- 🏆 I'm also competing in hackathons and case competitions to make connections and gain practical experience. 
  - My team won the Best National Team Award at [ENGCOMM 2022](https://www.engcomm.ca/) this February!
