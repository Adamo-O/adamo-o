### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Adamo and I'm a Software Engineering student in Co-op at Concordia University in Canada. Here's a bit about me!

ğŸ“š I'm currently finishing my first year at university, and I'm applying for internships to work in the Fall.

ğŸ’» I recently finished designing a portfolio website to show off my work in a more visual and artsy way! Check out the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Adamo-O/Portfolio-website) and the website itself [here](https://adamoorsini.com)!

â˜• Right now, I'm studying data structures & algorithms as well as React to build a stock trading web app with my friends later in the summer.
