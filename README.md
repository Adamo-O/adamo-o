### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Adamo and I'm a Software Engineering student in Co-op at Concordia University in Canada. Here's a bit about me!

ğŸ“š I'm currently finishing my first year at university, and preparing for my first work term in the Fall.

ğŸ’» I'm also working on a portfolio website to practice my web programming, to learn the React framework, and to show my projects and experience in a more personal and artsy way.
You can check my progress on my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Adamo-O/Portfolio-website)!
