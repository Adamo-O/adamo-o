<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm <a href="https://adamoorsini.com/">Adamo</a>!</h1>

## I'm a Computer Science Master's student in Canada. Here's a bit about me!

- 🏫 I recently started my Master's of Computer Science (Thesis) at Concordia University.
- 📚 I'm taking Representation Learning at MILA, while working on various side projects and preparing to start my research. 
- 💼 I'm seeking full-stack web development projects during my reserach, so reach out if you have an idea in mind!
- ⛳ I'm actively developing new features for [SoftGolf](https://softgolf.io) as CTO, so keep an eye out there for some of my newest work!
